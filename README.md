# Memory game

A simple memory game implemented in elm. There are 16 cards (8 pairs) in a deck, all of them face down. Your goal is to turn up the cards and find matching pairs. You can turn up 2 cards in one go. Do your best to remember which card is where in the deck.

- [ ] add step counter
- [ ] add timer
- [ ] a bit of code cleanup
